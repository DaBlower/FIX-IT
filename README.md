# Read More
A userscript to automatically expand truncated comments and replies so you don't have to click "read more"

### Features
- Expands truncated **YouTube comments**, including on Shorts and long-form videos.
- Clicks **"more replies"** buttons to reveal nested conversations in **Reddit**.

### Installation
To use this userscript, you will need a userscript manager such as [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/Violentmonkey/Violentmonkey) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php)

Once a manager is installed, install the userscript by, [going here](readmore.user.js) and clicking the **"raw"** button. This will open the script in your manager's userscript install page.
If you donâ€™t see an installation prompt, check that your userscript manager is active and installed.
